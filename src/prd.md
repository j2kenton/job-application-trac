## Implementation Considerations

### Email Integration Architecture
- **Forwarding Address Generation**: Unique addresses per user to prevent conflicts
- **Parser Resilience**: Graceful handling of various email formats
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when parsing fails or setup is incomplete

### Data Persistence
- **Storage Strategy**: useKV for persistent application data, useState for UI state
- **Data Structure**: Normalized application objects with consistent IDs
- **Migration Strategy**: Graceful handling of data structure changes

### User Experience Flow
1. **Setup**: Configure email forwarding with clear instructions
2. **Population**: Applications auto-populate from forwarded emails
3. **Management**: Manual editing and status updates as needed
4. **Tracking**: Filter and view applications by status

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

- **Email Parsing Failures**: Manual editing capability for incorrectly parsed data
- **Duplicate Detection**: User confirmation for potential duplicates
- **Missing Information**: Graceful degradation when email parsing is incomplete
- **Email Provider Variations**: Instructions for major email providers (Gmail, Outlook)

## Reflection

This approach uniquely combines automation with manual control, giving users the best of both worlds. The email forwarding setup removes friction from data entry while maintaining full editing capabilities for edge cases. The focus on professional design and clear status tracking makes this suitable for serious job seekers who need organized, reliable application management.
